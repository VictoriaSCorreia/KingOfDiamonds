# KingOfDiamonds
 A mathematical game inspired by the manga Alice in Borderland.
 
 ## How to play
 There are five inputs and each one can accept only an int value from 0 to 100. The winner of the round will be determined by the result of multiplying the average of the values by 0.8. 


 The player who gets closer to this result will not have its points reduced (-1), while the others will. Each player will start with 0 points, will lose the one who reaches -10. The game will end when there is only one player left.
 
 
 A new rule is introduced for every player eliminated.
 
 
 ### **4** players remaining:

If 2 players or more chooses the same number, the number becomes invalid, meaning they will lose a point even if the number is closest to 4/5ths the average.


 ### **3** players remaining:
 
 If there is a player who chooses the exact correct number, the loser penalty is doubled.
 
 
 ### **2** players remaining:
 
 If someone chooses 0, the player who chooses 100 is the winner.
